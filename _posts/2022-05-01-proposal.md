### FAQ

*Gangnam District* is one of the 25 local government districts which make up the city of Seoul, South Korea. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_District)

**Are you Korean?**
No. I'm a time traveler. I'm here to push SXP to the moon. I'm a long term hodler.

**Why do you choose the delegate name: gangnam?**
I'm a PSY's fanboy, I like his song: Gangnam Style. I wish there would be a chance to travel to Gangnam and Jeju Island.
