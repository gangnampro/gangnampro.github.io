### FAQ

**What is Gangnam?**

*Gangnam District* is one of the 25 local government districts which make up the city of Seoul, South Korea. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_District)

**Are you Korean?**

We're time travelers and long term hodlers. We're here to push SXP to the moon.

**Why do you choose the delegate name: gangnam?**

We heart PSY's song: Gangnam Style.
